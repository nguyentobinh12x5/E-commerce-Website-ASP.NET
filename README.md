E-commerce website selling men's fashion items with basic frontend-backend features, using ASP.Net Framework and Javascript + C# programming language
This project is for the E-Commerce Application Development course at UEH University
Note: The file name is BookStore because initially I intended to make a website to sell books, but after completing most of the features and creating the interface, I found selling clothes to be more beautiful hehe
+ Some basic user features: View goods, purchase, shopping cart and stripe payment
+ Some features for admins: account management, orders, products, status updates
+ Each feature has functions: add, edit, delete + filter
